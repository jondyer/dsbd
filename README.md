# Data Science and Big Data

Repo for work in "Data Science and Big Data" with Raja Sooriamurthi.

This course included lectures, homework, and projects covering topics such as:

* Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
* Scipy, scrapy, beautifulsoup
* Statistical analysis and data visualization
* Machine learning tools and methods
  * Scikit-learn
  * cross-validation
  * sentiment analysis
  * recommenders
  * classification, regression, clustering
* Genetic algorithms
* Apache Spark
* MapReduce
* Apache Pig

Projects were intended to exercise our newfound skills and provide practice at turning data into useful actionable insights. The two main projects were:

* [Project 1](projects/project1/project_1_report_final.ipynb), about how cost-effective a CMU education is ([video here](https://youtu.be/aybZ3MBRhCE)).
* [Project 2](projects/project2/project2.ipynb), which covers a supervised learning classification task to identify failing water pumps in rural Tanzania ([video here](https://www.loom.com/share/f95158bb2655491087053f924d55a092)).
